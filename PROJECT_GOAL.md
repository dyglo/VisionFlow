# ðŸŽ¯ Project Core Goal: VisionFlow

**VisionFlow** is an AI-powered full-stack application for visual object detection on user-uploaded images and videos. It leverages a YOLOv8 model in the backend to generate bounding boxes, labels, and detection scores. The platform is designed to be highly interactive and intuitive for visualizing, editing, and exporting annotated data.

## ðŸ’¡ Primary Objective

To build a production-ready object detection platform that supports:

- Image and video uploads
- YOLOv8-based AI inference
- Real-time bounding box overlays
- Interactive annotations
- Clean and responsive UI
- Export functionality in multiple annotation formats (YOLO, COCO, VOC)

---

## âœ… Current Project Status

- [x] YOLOv8 backend functional (hosted via FastAPI)
- [x] Frontend app bootstrapped with React and TailwindCSS
- [x] Image upload + detection works (but needs UI cleanup)
- [x] Downloadable annotated results (.zip) is functional
- [ ] Bounding boxes need enhanced visibility (thicker stroke, better labeling)
- [ ] Video upload and detection pipeline still pending
- [ ] Refined export formats (JSON, PNG, etc.) need implementation
